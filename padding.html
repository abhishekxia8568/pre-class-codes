                In its most general sense, the term "world" refers to the totality of entities, to the whole of
            reality or to everything that is.[1] The nature of the world has been conceptualized differently
            in different fields. Some conceptions see the world as unique while others talk of a "plurality
            of worlds". Some treat the world as one simple object while others analyze the world as a complex
            made up of many parts. In scientific cosmology the world or universe is commonly defined as "[t]he
            totality of all space and time; all that is, has been, and will be". Theories of modality,
